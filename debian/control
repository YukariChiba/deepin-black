Description: uncompromising Python code formatter (Python 3)
 Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you
 agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return,
 Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle
 nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for
 more important matters.
 .
 Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading.
 Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the
 content instead.
 .
 Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs
 possible.
